- Using Ledit tool to make the layout.
- Using PSPICE circuit simulator to make the Post-Layout simulation.

## ABSTRACT

Arithmetic Logic Operations (Process) is Very Important Functions in Digital Domain Processing and Any Processor requires Arithmetic Block to be able to do different functions and Boolean Expressions, so one of the most important Operations that are wide used in Digital Domain is Division and Multiplication Blocks. We will be able to design Multiplication and Division Block by Using a certain Sequence of Adder and Subtraction Cells. Using Gaijeski Y-chart, starting from the Algorithm on the architecture level and to verify the functionality we used the RTL language (Verilog code) and see the results on XILINX ISE simulator tool, then we moved to logic level when we used the standard cells from CUSCLIB library cells. Finally we go the layout on the circuit level.
